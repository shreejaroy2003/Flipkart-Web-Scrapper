# Flipkart-Web-Scrapper
# Task 1: Python Project - Web Scraping on Flipkart
# Objective:
The goal is to build a Python-based web scraper that can extract product details, prices, ratings, and reviews from Flipkart. This will help us analyze market trends and consumer behavior.
# What You Need to Do:
# Research:
1. Understand web scraping fundamentals and ethics.
2. Explore libraries like BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, and Selenium.
3. Review Flipkart's website structure and identify the necessary HTML elements for scraping.
# Design:
# Plan the Features:
1. Identify the product categories you will scrape.
2. Define the data points to be extracted (e.g., product name, price, rating, number of reviews).
# Create a Flowchart:
1. Outline the scraping process from accessing the webpage to storing the data.
2. Include error handling and data validation steps.
# Setup:
1. Install necessary Python libraries and tools.
2. Write a script to navigate Flipkart's website.
# Data Extraction:
1. Use BeautifulSoup or Scrapy to parse HTML and extract data.
2. Implement Selenium if dynamic content loading needs to be handled.
# Data Storage:
1. Store extracted data in a structured format such as CSV or JSON.
2. Ensure data consistency and handle duplicates.
# Error Handling:
1. Implement retries and error logging.
2. Handle potential changes in Flipkartâ€™s website structure.
# Functionality Testing:
1. Verify the scraper accurately extracts the required data.
2. Test with different product categories and pages.
# Performance Testing:
1. Measure the time taken to scrape data and optimize if necessary.
# Robustness Testing:
1. Ensure the scraper can handle unexpected changes or errors gracefully.
 
# Code: The complete Python script for the web scraper.
